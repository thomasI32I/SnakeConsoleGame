# SnakeConsoleGame


*******************************************************
This project was created in eclipse.


Motivation
*******************************************************
In the book "Java ist auch eine Insel (11. edition)" in chapter three, there is an example code of how to create the game snake as simple console application. It is primary implemented by using imperative programming style like using mostly primititve data types, for and while loops. My attemp was to write cohesive and encapsulated code for fun and to improve my design skills :-). This code is by far not perfect it is an (first) attempt. 



Game content and rules
*******************************************************
Game items: Player (&), Snake (S), Gold ($), Door (#)

Goal: Collect gold pieces and reach the door before the snakes gets the player.
